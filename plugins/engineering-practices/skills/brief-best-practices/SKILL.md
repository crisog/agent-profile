## What a brief is

A `BRIEF.md` is the **verifier's spec** — the codified taste that says what "good" means for a surface, so an agent can verify its own iterations and run a loop without guessing or interrupting. Where `SPEC.md` is the contract (*what* to build: `REQ-*`, invariants), the brief is the bar (*what "good" is*, and *who judges*).

It is the **BRIEF** rung in the stack `VISION → SPEC + BRIEF → HARNESS → LOOP → BOUNDARY`: the brief is what makes a surface's autonomous loop trustworthy, because the harness runs objective floors and the oracle exercises or judges the dimensions the harness cannot. An optional `.mission/mission.yaml` owns strategic success when an outcome spans campaigns; BRIEF owns surface quality and never duplicates a mission rubric.

## When to author one

Author or update a brief when work will **loop** (you'll iterate against it more than once) or when the **cost of being wrong is high**. Trivial, one-shot changes need no brief — do not manufacture ceremony; *propose* an expensive brief+harness before investing in it.

Subjective surfaces (a docs page, a report, a visual artifact) get a **mini-brief** before the first draft: one reference to mirror plus a 3-line never-list. Capture any post-hoc taste correction into that surface's Decisions the same session — an uncodified correction recurs.

## Naming & placement

Always `BRIEF.md`, colocated with the surface it governs: root for project scope, `apps/foo/BRIEF.md`, `packages/bar/BRIEF.md`, or a docs subtree (e.g. `docs/toys/BRIEF.md`). Working memory never lives beside the brief as sidecar docs (`DELTA.md`, `DEVIATIONS.md`): per-round gaps and iteration facts belong to the campaign's LOOP.md State (loop-brief skill), and an infeasible floor's waiver is law, not working memory — it lives in the brief's own Decisions, dated, naming the floor, the blocker, and the nearest-feasible alternative in force. A sidecar found beside a brief dissolves (dissolve-docs skill). The brief is present-tense law; git is the changelog.

## The seven slots (required concerns, adaptable shape)

The contract is that all seven *concerns* are present, in this order — not a fixed `##`-count. The *content* adapts to the domain (a payments flow, an indexer, a CLI, a 3D toy); the *concerns* never change. A domain may split a concern across sections, or close with a culminating **"Final acceptance"** coda: one whole-surface test that restates the Boundary as a gate ("then the human ships it; the real gate is a user who…"). That coda is a framing of Boundary + Oracle, not an illegal eighth slot. The rule is *don't drop a concern* — not *don't add a heading*; still, keep sections as few as the content allows. **Absent a house dialect (see Authoring rules), these seven are the skeleton.**

1. **Bar** — one sentence: what "shippable" means for this surface. The north-star "done."
2. **Dimensions** — the few axes "good" decomposes into (correctness, idempotency, auditability, security, latency, recognizability…). Keep it short; these are the quality factors, not a feature list. A surface with side effects carries **observability** as a dimension by default — its floor is that a failure is diagnosable from emitted artifacts alone, without re-running.
3. **Floors** — the minimum on each dimension *with how it's measured* (a floor without a measurement method is useless: "p95 < 200ms, measured via X"). The gate, **not the ceiling** — passing the floor licenses ship, not perfection.
4. **Oracle** — the independent verifier: what runs, who executes or judges, and
   **why it can't be gamed** (maker ≠ terminal judge). Pick the pattern that fits
   the surface: property tests or a staging run against forked state (objective
   surfaces); a **fresh-participant bug bash** whose charter names the exact
   artifact, environment, roles, representative tasks, expected outcomes,
   evidence, severity floor, and budget (operable applications and systems); a
   **deterministic simulator over fixed golden/archetypal inputs** whose emitted
   trajectory a domain expert reads (pure engines); or a **blind human-judge
   quorum** for subjective first impressions. Author-run dogfood is discovery,
   not an independent terminal. Use specialized static review only when the
   named quality cannot be exercised. For live systems the oracle extends past
   ship into **telemetry** — the signals that confirm it stays good.
5. **Never** — outcomes that are always a fail regardless of everything else (the safety invariants / "never events"). Concrete and absolute.
6. **Decisions** — calls already made, the **tradeoff/priority policy** ("security > latency; security can force a redesign, latency cannot"), and assumptions, so the agent never re-asks. This section **grows**, in two tiers: **ratified** (human-confirmed) and **provisional** (a reversible interior call the driver made via the unblocking ladder — dated, with rationale, ratified or overturned at the boundary). This is where mid-loop questions go to die.
7. **Boundary** — what requires the human: publish, biometric, live secrets, and genuine unknowns. Naming it tells the agent exactly what it may and may not do unattended.

**Show, don't just tell.** Any slot that is ambiguous earns a concrete instance — a golden example and/or an anti-example. Agents ground on exemplars; the Never list and the Oracle especially benefit.

## Governance preamble

Open every brief with a one-line law statement, e.g.:

> Law doc for `<surface>`, present-tense, no narrated history — git is the changelog. The Boundary and ratified Decisions amend only with human confirmation; the driver appends provisional Decisions, marked and dated. Working memory lives in the campaign's LOOP.md State, not here; floor waivers are dated Decisions below.

## Authoring rules

- **Match the house first.** If the repo already has ratified briefs, copy *their* shape — section names, voice, any closing coda — over this skeleton. Consistency across the brief set beats the generic template; the seven concerns are the fallback when no house dialect exists yet. Evaluate a brief against the house dialect; matching the repo's own law is not a defect.
- **Evidence-based.** Ground Dimensions and Floors in the real surface; cite reference exemplars. Do not invent thresholds, signals, or behaviors.
- **No strategic duplication.** Link mission rubric ids when the surface serves
  a declared mission, but do not restate outcome criteria as BRIEF dimensions or floors.
  A mission asks whether the outcome succeeded; a BRIEF asks whether this
  surface is good enough.
- **The oracle must be independent where judgment is experiential or
  subjective.** Maker ≠ terminal judge. A fresh bug-bash participant receives
  the task charter and artifact, not the author's reasoning or suspected bugs.
  Name why the gate cannot be gamed.
- **Floors are gates, not ceilings.** A passing artifact may still owe refinement; say so. Never weaken a floor to pass a gate — an infeasible item gets the nearest-feasible alternative plus a dated waiver Decision naming the blocker, and the gap stays on record.
- **Calibrate claims to enforcement.** Match absolutist words ("never", "cannot") to what the oracle actually proves. Overclaiming invites reject cycles.
- **Parsimony.** Few, well-crafted floors that cover the cases beat a long brittle list. The brief is read every loop; every line earns its place.
- **Floors discriminate.** A floor earns its place by reddening on the defect and staying green through behavior-preserving change. One that reddens on every edit is noise the loop learns to override; one that cannot redden at all is theater. Neither measures the dimension it claims to.
- **Mutation policy.** The Boundary amends only with explicit human confirmation, and ratified Decisions are never re-litigated. The driver appends provisional Decisions freely — that is the ladder working — marked as such and never silently promoted to ratified. When brief/implementation drift is found, surface it — the human decides.

## Lifecycle

- **Creation.** When work begins to loop or the cost of being wrong is high. Draft the seven slots; the human ratifies. The harness is built to run the Floors; the Oracle is wired before iteration starts (harness-first).
- **Maintenance.** Decisions grow from two feeds: answered boundary batches, and provisional entries ratified (or overturned) at the boundary — an interactive question is the exception, not the source. Corrections whose reach outlives the surface route to the doctrine instead. Floors tighten as the bar rises (rewrite as if always true). Cross-check the brief against the implementation whenever both are in context; surface drift.
- **Retirement.** When a surface is removed, remove or archive its `BRIEF.md`. Do not leave a stale law describing deleted behavior.

## How the brief drives the loop

The brief is inert until it runs: the **harness** runs objective Floors and emits
pass/fail with evidence; the **oracle** executes real-use tasks or judges the
remaining Dimensions independently; the **OODA loop** iterates against them to
`done` or a bounded, honest `blocked`. In a campaign, LOOP.md targets this
brief's floors by name (`targets.brief`) and carries the loop's live state and
decisions.

## References

- `template.md` — the blank seven-concern skeleton, copy-paste ready *when no house dialect exists yet*; if the repo already has briefs, mirror those instead.
- `example-payments.md` — a filled brief for a money-transfer flow: the **objective** archetype, where floors are machine-checkable and the oracle is property tests + staging. The **subjective/taste** archetype — a visual or design surface whose bar is "elegant, calm, recognizable" and whose oracle is a blind human-judge quorum (maker ≠ judge) closing on a culminating "Final acceptance" frame — is the harder, more common product case; build its oracle from the blind-judge pattern in the Oracle slot.

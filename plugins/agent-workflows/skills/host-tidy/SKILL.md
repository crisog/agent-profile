# host-tidy

Reclaim an overloaded dev host by finding processes and stacks whose **owner
is gone**, then clearing them without touching live work.

The whole skill is one discrimination: **orphan vs. active**. Getting it
wrong in one direction wastes a core for two weeks; getting it wrong in the
other destroys someone's running environment. Age alone never decides it —
attribution does.

## Hard rules

- **Never kill before attributing.** Every target needs a named reason its
  owner is gone (see Ownership evidence). "It is old" and "it looks stale"
  are not reasons.
- **Prefer the project's sanctioned teardown** over hand-killing PIDs and
  containers. A stack's own `down` command knows about halves you have not
  found yet.
- **Never remove one compose-managed member as an isolated fix.** Tear down the
  complete attributed project as a group; leaving hand-selected members behind
  wedges the project.
- **Proven orphans are interior — clear them and report.** Anything
  ambiguous, data-bearing, or shared batches into one confirmation.
- **An approval is bound to the evidence it was given on.** Attribution
  continues right up to the teardown command. If a target turns out to be
  live after it was approved, the approval is void — stop, say which
  evidence changed, and re-ask. Approval granted on a wrong premise is not
  authorization.
- **Data reclaim is always opt-in and separate.** Never fold volume/image
  pruning, database deletion, or a factory reset into process cleanup. Inventory
  exact targets and the data they hold, then obtain explicit authorization for
  that deletion alone.
- **Shared hosts belong to other people too.** Confirm before clearing
  anything you did not start.

## Workflow

### 1) Measure before touching anything

Capture the baseline so the effect is provable afterward:

```bash
# macOS
uptime; sysctl -n hw.ncpu hw.memsize
vm_stat | awk '/Pages free/{gsub(/\./,"",$3); printf "free: %.0f MB\n", $3*16384/1048576}'
echo "procs: $(ps -A | wc -l)  limit: $(sysctl -n kern.maxprocperuid)"

# Linux
uptime; nproc; free -h
echo "procs: $(ps -e --no-headers | wc -l)"
ps -eo state --no-headers | sort | uniq -c   # D-state and Z counts
```

Then the shape of the load — a name histogram beats a top-N list, because
leaks show up as *counts*, not as one hot process:

```bash
ps -Ao comm | sed 's|.*/||' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20   # macOS
ps -eo comm --no-headers | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20      # Linux
```

Hundreds of `postgres`, `nginx`, or runtime processes means a runaway stack,
not a stray process — go to step 2's container half first.

**Under severe load the container daemon itself starves.** Put explicit
timeouts on every `docker`/`kubectl` call, run long sweeps detached, and
never re-issue a hung command — that is piling on, not retrying.

### 2) Inventory both halves

Dev stacks leak in two halves and clearing one leaves the other running:

**Host processes** — anything reparented to init (`PPID 1`) after its
launcher died ungracefully:

```bash
ps -Ao pid,ppid,etime,%cpu,rss,command | awk '$2==1' \
  | grep -iE '\b(bun|node|deno|python[0-9.]*|tilt|vite|esbuild|java|cargo)\b' \
  | grep -vE '/Applications/|Cellar|/System/|/nix/store'
```

**Containers and clusters** — grouped by project, never by individual name:

```bash
timeout 30 docker ps -a --format '{{.Label "com.docker.compose.project"}}|{{.Names}}|{{.Status}}'
timeout 20 docker system df
timeout 20 k3d cluster list          # or: kubectl config get-contexts
```

A supervisor-driven localnet typically owns a compose project **and** a
cluster + registry. Also check the session multiplexer's own view (e.g.
`zmx ls`) — it records sessions the process table cannot explain.

### 3) Attribute ownership

For each candidate, find the strongest available evidence. Higher on this
list wins; a single hit is enough to classify.

| Evidence | How to read it |
|---|---|
| **The stack's own status command** | Ask the tool that owns the stack (`<project> status`, `silo status`, `tilt get`). A stack reporting **stopped** while its containers or cluster still run is an orphan by its own account; one reporting **running** is live. Cheapest and most authoritative — check it first |
| **Owning directory deleted** | `lsof -a -p <pid> -d cwd` (macOS) / `readlink /proc/<pid>/cwd` (Linux); compose: `docker inspect -f '{{index .Config.Labels "com.docker.compose.project.working_dir"}}'`. Gone directory → **orphan** |
| **Supervisor recorded an exit** | The multiplexer/supervisor lists the session as ended with an exit code while the process still runs → **orphan** (the directory may still exist — this outranks it) |
| **Waiting on a dead endpoint** | A poll loop against a port with no listener (`lsof -nP -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN`) → **orphan** |
| **Scratch state already deleted** | Temp dir / socket / lock the process was built around is gone → **orphan** |
| **Recent commits in the owning worktree** | `git -C <dir> log -1 --format='%h %s (%cr)'` → **active**, leave it |
| **Live inbound connections** | Established sockets on the stack's service ports → **active**, leave it |
| **No owner found** | → **ambiguous**, batch for confirmation. Never promote to orphan by age |

Elapsed time only *ranks* orphans by cost. A 24-minute stack with a live
worktree is active work; a 13-day process with a deleted worktree is waste.

### 4) Classify into three tiers and report

- **Tier 1 — proven orphan.** Attribution evidence names the dead owner.
  Interior: clear it and report.
- **Tier 2 — ambiguous, data-bearing, or shared.** No owner found,
  anonymous volumes attached, or started by someone else. Batch into **one**
  confirmation with the evidence shown.
- **Tier 3 — busy but legitimate.** Report cost, propose nothing. This is
  where the real consumption usually is: an active stack is expensive
  because it is running, not because it leaked.

Present the tiers with cost per item before acting. Name explicitly what you
are **not** touching and why — that list is as useful as the kill list.

### 5) Tear down stacks with their own command

Discover the sanctioned teardown before improvising (`package.json` scripts,
`Makefile`, the project's README):

```bash
# example shape: supervisor down -> compose down -> generated runtime cleanup
<pkg-runner> run localnet:down
```

**Read what each teardown level actually does before picking one.** Projects
routinely ship a graduated pair — a `down` that stops the workload but
*keeps* the cluster, and a `clean`/`purge` that adds `--delete-cluster`. On
a host you are reclaiming, `down` leaves the multi-GB half you came for
still running. Check the script's own definition rather than guessing from
the verb. Also inspect whether a wrapper expands to `compose down -v`, volume
removal, database deletion, or reset. Process-cleanup authority does not cover
those effects: use a non-data-deleting level or stop at the data boundary.

Use the project's own package runner, not a habitual one — a repo whose
lockfile belongs to a different package manager will refuse to run, and the
wrapper's error is about the lockfile, not about your command being wrong.

Stop the **supervisor first** so it reaps its own children gracefully, then
run the teardown. Verify the child daemons and connections actually dropped
before moving on. Afterwards sweep for stragglers by project prefix —
side-stacks defined in a second compose file are routinely missed:

```bash
docker ps -a --format '{{.Names}}' | grep '<project-prefix>'
```

When no sanctioned teardown wrapper exists, first recover the Compose working
directory and config-file labels and invoke Compose against that exact project.
If those inputs no longer exist, build and print a project-scoped manifest of
every container and network, verify their labels immediately before acting, and
remove the group—not a fresh query result and not selected members. This fallback
still excludes volumes:

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{json .Config.Labels}}' <reviewed-container-id>
docker rm -f <reviewed-project-container-ids>
docker network rm <reviewed-project-network-ids>
```

Omit `-v` on `docker rm` when a container has **anonymous** volumes you did
not prove disposable — the process dies, the data survives on disk. A local
cluster may carry databases or persistent volumes; delete it only when inventory
proves it disposable or separate authorization names that data-bearing target.

### Data reclaim is a separate boundary

After compute cleanup, inventory retained data without deleting it:

```bash
docker volume ls --filter "label=com.docker.compose.project=<project>"
docker volume inspect <volume-name>
docker system df -v
```

For each exact volume, image set, database, or reset target, report ownership,
attachments, size, and what recovery source exists. Ask for one authorization
that names those targets and the data loss. Immediately before deletion,
re-check identity and attachments; changed evidence voids the authorization.
Delete only the approved names—never a fresh query result, wildcard, or global
prune—and verify what remains afterward.

### 6) Kill with verify-before-signal, then escalate

PIDs get reused. Re-confirm identity immediately before signalling, in the
same command that signals:

```bash
cmd=$(ps -p "$PID" -o command= 2>/dev/null || true)
case "$cmd" in
  *<expected-substring>*) kill "$PID" && echo "TERM $PID" ;;
  *) echo "SKIP $PID (identity changed: '$cmd')" ;;
esac
```

Then SIGTERM → verify → SIGKILL only the survivors. A wedged process
ignoring SIGTERM is expected, not a surprise.

Before reaping duplicates of a **daemon that backs live sessions**, prove
which instance holds the live socket and exclude it:

```bash
lsof -nP <state-dir>/<name>.sock | awk 'NR>1{print $2}' | sort -u
```

Build the kill manifest by exclusion (dev/build paths in, installed path
out), print it, then execute — and re-check the socket afterward.

### 7) Verify and tally

Re-measure load, free memory, and per-class counts against step 1. State
each count as `now (was N)`.

**Load average lags** — it is a decaying 1/5/15-minute mean, so a freed core
shows up immediately in CPU but slowly in load. Cite the 1-minute number as
*decaying*, not as the result, and never claim a recovery the process counts
do not corroborate.

### 8) Name the leak, not just the mess

A sweep that does not identify why the host filled up guarantees a repeat.
Report the mechanism when the evidence supports one:

- **Ungraceful supervisor death** — foreground child processes started by a
  supervisor reparent to init when it is killed rather than shut down. Every
  long-running child is an orphan-in-waiting; random-port services accumulate
  invisibly because they never collide.
- **Host-scaled sizing with no cap** — connection pools, thread pools, and
  heaps sized to host cores/RAM. Fine for one stack, fatal for four
  concurrently. The fix is per-instance sizing plus a host-wide concurrency
  cap, not a bigger sweep.
- **No lifecycle/TTL** — nothing expires a stack whose branch was deleted.

File it or point at the existing issue. Repeated identical sweeps are the
symptom of an unfixed structural leak.

## Red flags

- Killing by age, name pattern, or process count without attribution
- Removing selected `com.docker.compose.*` containers while leaving other
  project members behind
- Clearing the compose half and leaving the cluster + registry half up
- Running the `down` level when only `clean` deletes the cluster
- Bundling `docker volume prune` into a process cleanup
- Running `compose down -v`, `docker volume rm`, a database purge, or a factory
  reset under process-cleanup authority
- Re-issuing a hung `docker`/`kubectl` call on a starved daemon
- Declaring victory from the 1-minute load average alone
- Reusing a previous sweep's exclusion rule (a path prefix, a PID list)
  instead of re-deriving it — which instance holds the live socket changes
  between sessions, and last time's rule will eventually cut live work
- A "duplicate stack" claim built on a misread elapsed-time field — check
  `etime` units before calling a collision

# Writing Plans

## Overview

Turn requirements into an executable plan with concrete files, tests, and verification. A good plan removes guesswork without pretending the implementation is already done.

**Core principle:** Every task should be specific enough that an engineer can execute it without inventing missing requirements.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- The task spans multiple files, phases, or checks
- Requirements are stable enough to plan
- The work benefits from a written execution order

Do not use this skill when:
- The change is small enough to track directly in your harness's plan/progress mechanism, when one exists
- Requirements are still ambiguous
- The user asked to implement immediately and the work is trivial

## Before Writing the Plan

1. Read the relevant code, docs, and existing specs.
2. Confirm the scope is one coherent unit of work.
3. Stop and clarify if the plan would depend on guessed requirements.

If the request covers multiple independent changes, split it into separate plans or clearly separated task groups.

## Plan Format

When a `LOOP.md` exists for the branch, the plan is its `units` list, not a
separate doc. Each unit names the SPEC requirements, BRIEF floors, or mission
rubric ids it advances (`targets`). A unit that advances no target is omitted
unless a SPEC invariant or safety requirement makes it necessary; cite that
requirement in the unit.

Otherwise, save the plan where the user asked. If they did not specify a location, use:

`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

Start with:

```markdown
# <Topic> Implementation Plan

**Goal:** <one sentence>
**Scope:** <what this plan covers>
**Non-goals:** <what this plan intentionally avoids>
**Risks:** <key technical or rollout risks>
**First working milestone:** <the smallest end-to-end result and how it will be observed>
```

Then include:

### Files
- Create: `path/to/new_file`
- Modify: `path/to/existing_file`
- Test: `path/to/test_file`

### Task N: <name>
- Targets: `<REQ-ID | Floor | RUBRIC-ID>`
- Outcome: <what is true when this task is done>
- Reuse: <existing code and behavior it builds on>
- Steps:
  - Write or update the failing test
  - Run the targeted check and confirm the expected failure
  - Implement the minimal change
  - Re-run targeted verification
  - Apply the code-health law, refactor while green, and re-run the targeted check
  - Run broader regression checks if needed
- Verification:
  - `exact command`
  - expected result
- Dependencies:
  - `Task N-1` or `none`

## Planning Rules

- Use exact file paths.
- Prefer tasks that can be verified independently.
- Encode test-first thinking when the task changes runtime behavior.
- Start from a written QA design: map each material risk to the cheapest faithful
  evidence instead of filling every test layer by habit.
- When the existing structure fights the feature, put a behavior-preserving
  prefactor unit first when it can be independently green. Keep the behavior
  change in the following unit so either step is understandable and reversible.
- Include commands that can actually be run from the repo.
- Keep steps concrete: "add parser for X in `foo.ts`", not "improve parsing".
- Keep unrelated refactors out unless they are required to make the change safe.
- Give each task a risk class; the ADF law defines the high-risk set and its approval requirement.
- Include a back-of-envelope resource sketch for data-plane work (per-request/per-item hot paths).
- Plan the first working vertical slice before hardening or optimization; organize tasks around observable behavior, not technical layers.
- For an operable surface, keep the bug-bash artifact, environment, task or time
  budget, and severity floor explicit. High-risk ADF classes default to a
  matching bounded specialist review unless the human records a PLAN waiver;
  other classes add one only for a named risk that execution cannot decide. Put
  selected review before the terminal bug bash and never invent an open-ended
  review loop.

## Complexity Check

Before presenting the plan, state which systems it touches, any new
infrastructure it introduces, the requirement supporting each addition, and
why the existing flow is insufficient. An addition without a supporting
requirement moves out of the plan into deferred work.

## Execution Handoff

If the plan will be executed in the same session:
- Mirror the task list in your harness's plan/progress mechanism, when one exists
- Keep one task in progress at a time
- Revise the plan if implementation reveals real gaps

Independent sidecar work may run as parallel bounded subagents with
non-overlapping ownership; the critical path defaults to the packetized
delegation stream (rules of engagement).

## Red Flags

- Plans that rely on tool names from another harness
- Tasks that touch the same files from multiple parallel workers
- Missing verification steps
- Hidden migrations, schema changes, or contract changes buried in generic wording
- Placeholder language like "update as needed" or "handle edge cases"

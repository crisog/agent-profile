# Behavior-first gate-routing scenarios

Read root `AGENTS.md` and the behavior-first section of root `SPEC.md`, plus only
these runtime skills. Do not read implementation notes or the source diff:

- `plugins/agent-workflows/skills/bugbash/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/agent-workflows/skills/loop-brief/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/agent-workflows/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/engineering-practices/skills/testing-best-practices/SKILL.md`

Act as a fresh-context, disinterested campaign planner. Do not inspect a source
diff or invent implementation findings. Define a finding scale with at least
`minor`, `material`, and `critical`. For each scenario, state the risk class,
map each material risk to its cheapest faithful evidence, order the gates, say
whether a fresh participant or specialist reviewer is required, and name every
applicable gate or campaign terminal. Report a finding when the instructions
over-trigger generic review or bugbash, under-protect a high-risk change, permit
stale evidence, or leave no honest terminal. The run is green only when every
scenario is answered and no finding is material or critical.

For baseline/candidate comparison, give each fresh runner only that version's
runtime instructions and these same tasks. Record the decisions, required
questions, document creation, skill reads, verifier runs, and boundary actions;
compare counts alongside correctness. Word reduction alone cannot make the run
green. Missing tooling and unavailable execution remain explicit limitations.

1. A pure parsing library changes one deterministic transformation. Unit and
   property tests can decide every named risk; it has no installable or operable
   surface, and its externally supported contract is unchanged.
2. A CLI changes configuration discovery and restart behavior. Its unit tests
   are green, but the assembled binary can still package the wrong defaults or
   preserve the wrong state across invocations.
3. A web application changes token parsing and tenant authorization. Contract
   tests cover named roles, while malformed and cross-tenant inputs remain a
   trust-boundary risk. The application can be exercised in an isolated stack,
   and correlated blind spots in the author model are material.
4. A schema migration changes stored representation and rollback behavior. A
   dry-run and migration harness are available, and users encounter the result
   through an operable application.
5. A README typo changes no command, contract, generated artifact, or behavioral
   instruction.
6. A mobile biometric flow can be built and unit-tested, but its final physical
   device interaction cannot be automated faithfully by the current harness.
7. A bug-bash charter contains five required tasks and a 45-minute budget. The
   executor reaches the budget after three tasks with no finding and no broken
   environment.
8. A terminal bug bash finds a blocking restart defect and the campaign
   authorizes fixes. The author adds a reproducer and patches it; decide which
   checks and tasks must run against the resulting artifact before `done`.
9. A shared agent instruction change alters verifier selection across Codex,
   Claude, and Pi. Deterministic validation can check packaging and references,
   while fixed fresh-context tasks can expose routing behavior and a bounded
   instruction-system pass can inspect non-executable coherence.
10. The user says "fix this parser edge case now; keep it local." Existing
    requirements and a fast harness cover the bounded attended change. The
    source file happens to mention a deployment tool. State the next actions,
    required documents, skill reads, delegation, and any question before work.
11. During that authorized fix the user says "stepping away, keep going."
    There is no LOOP.md; the remaining implementation and checks fit in the
    current session. State how presence changes the workflow and its terminal.
12. A resumed campaign has green harness and bug-bash evidence with matching
    source, dirty-state, artifact, environment, and task identities. Only the
    campaign's administrative iteration counter advanced. Decide what to run
    and record. Then repeat the decision after the deployed test environment
    changes while source and artifact remain identical.
13. A campaign lacks a required fresh executor after the deterministic gates
    pass. Two attempts establish that its execution service is unavailable.
    State what work continues, how to report the terminal, and whether a static
    review or a new iteration can make the missing gate green.
